## What are React Componenets?
React applications are totally made out of  componenets.
React componets are like building blocks for user interface in react.
React takes all the components and combine them together to build one single webpage UI.
React renders for each of the componenet and all of them together make up the UI.
Components can be said as a piece of user interface.
Each componenet has its own data, javascript code, and logic.
